description: I have been working on a fun little project called <a href="https://jonas-hampeis.github.io/spiral-text/">Spiral Text</a>, which is pretty much self-explanatory. You give the app the text and it creates an image with the text in a spiral! There are a few modifications you can make to the picture. You can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/jonas-hampeis/spiral-text">GitHub</a>.
